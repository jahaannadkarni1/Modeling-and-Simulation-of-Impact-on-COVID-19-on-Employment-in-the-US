# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Impact-on-COVID-19-on-Employment-in-the-US

This project was a group effort wherein we collected data about the various keywords relating to the COVID-19. We then used those keywords and created a VENSIM model and used the various rates and population at risk and performed a simulation of how it will affect the civilization and business in the USA. We also performed the model to predict the Impacts of Employement in the USA based on different Lockdown Situations.

• VENSIM model simulating the impacts of COVID-19 using rates (infectivity, recovery) and population.

• Created graphs showing different lockdown situations (0%-100%), its effect of employment, business.
